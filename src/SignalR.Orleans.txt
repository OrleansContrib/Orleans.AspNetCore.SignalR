Disadvantages with SignalR.Orleans

Code is more complicated than necessary
- ConnectionGrain is not really representing a connection, but a collection of connections which is confusing
- Sending ONE message to a group with 1000 connections means: 
  * 1000 messages routed to 1000 ClientGrains 
  * 1000 individual messages pushed to servers via streams
  
  A better solution could be to only send ONE message for each server that has a connection in the group
