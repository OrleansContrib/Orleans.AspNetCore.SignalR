Keep Orleans.SignalR name?


LOCAL GRAIN PLACEMENT
HubGrain and ConnectionGrain has the [PreferLocalPlacement] attribute. 
This ensures (well 99.99%) that when we route a message to a connection


CLEANUPS
How to clean up connection grains when a server has not been able to shutdown correctly?
- when using table storage I think we have a primary key (serverId?) and secondary key connectionId(). If a server goes down we can remove all connections with a certain severId

WRITE GRAIN STATE STRATEGY
When should grain state be stored?


HUB ID
ServerId should be HubId, because the id represents the hub, not the full server.

Instead of Guid, we use a string. HubId can be set from outside, which is good when testing and we want to have clear server hub name such as "Server1_UserHub" and "Server2_UserHub"
